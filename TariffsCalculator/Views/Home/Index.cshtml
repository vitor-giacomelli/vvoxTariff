        <p>Task: Tariff Comparison Develop a model to build up the following two products and to compare these products based on their annual costs.</p>
        <p>The comparison should accept the following input parameter: •Consumption (kWh/year) and create a list of these products with the columns</p>
        <p> •Tariff name •Annual costs (€/year) The list should be sorted by costs in ascending order.</p>
        <p>&emsp;Products</p>
        <p>1.Product A Name: “basic electricity tariff” Calculation model: base costs per month 5 € + consumption costs 22 cent/kWh</p>
        <p>&emsp;Examples:</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;•Consumption = 3500 kWh/year => Annual costs = 830 €/year (5€ * 12 months = 60 € base costs + 3500 kWh/year * 22 cent/kWh = 770 € consumption costs)</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;•Consumption = 4500 kWh/year => Annual costs = 1050 €/year (5€ * 12 months = 60 € base costs + 4500 kWh/year * 22 cent/kWh = 990 € consumption costs)</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;•Consumption = 6000 kWh/year => Annual costs = 1380 €/year (5€ * 12 months = 60 € base costs + 6000 kWh/year * 22 cent/kWh = 1320 € consumption costs)</p>
        <p>2.Product B Name: “Packaged tariff” Calculation model: 800 € for up to 4000 kWh/year and above 4000 kWh/year additionally 30 cent/kWh.</p>
        <p>&emsp;Examples:</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;•Consumption = 3500 kWh/year => Annual costs = 800 €/year</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;•Consumption = 4500 kWh/year => Annual costs = 950 €/year (800€ + 500 kWh * 30 cent/kWh = 150 € additional consumption costs)</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;•Consumption = 6000 kWh/year => Annual costs = 1400 €/year (800€ + 2000 kWh * 30 cent/kWh = 600 € additional consumption costs) RESTful serviceCreate a RESTful service to retrieve the products via GETIf you write tests for your implementation please provide them with your implementation.
